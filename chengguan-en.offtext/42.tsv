1	Sutra: Sanskrit, Buddhist Holy Scripture. 修多羅，經 
2	the World-Venerated One: Sanskrit: Bhagavam. This is one of the Ten Holy Epithets of the Buddha, meaning: one who is venerated by all the worlds, or worshipped universally, on account of his unconditioned Compassion and unparalleled Wisdom. 世尊 
3	Dhyanaic Stasis: same as Samadhi. 禪定 
4	Mara: a demonic celestial being, who usually becomes jealous when he descries people practicing the Truthful Way, and so he would not hesitate to throw all kinds of impediments in their way. 魔 
5	the Truthful-Way: I.e., the way for Bodhi, or Enlightenment. 道 
6	Bhiksu: Sansk., an ordained Buddhist monk, who has formally received the 250 Precepts of Bhiksu-ship conferred by three High Priests, in conjunction with the witness of seven other High Priests (altogether called the Ten Gurus) in an ordination ceremony combined with training, which traditionally is a retreat of thirty-two-day intensive discipline. 比丘 
7	Sramana: Sansk., originally meaning: one who practices diligently to exterminate Greed, Anger, and Inanity; in later use, denoting, specif., the ordained monks or nuns in Buddhism. 沙門 
8	renounce the Worldly Home: I.e., to become a monk. 出家 
9	Samgha: Sansk., meaning the Buddhist Order, or a group of ordained monks or nuns collectively. Although the word Samgha in its origin may mean an Assembly of either ecclesiastical or lay people, yet traditionally it has come to be used to refer to “a group of priests” exclusively; hence, it would be very inappropriate for a group of lay Buddhists to call themselves “a Samgha,” which would not only created a confusion of status, but also would involve a transgression on the Precepts; viz., “professing oneself as an ordained priest without really being so.” 僧、僧伽 
10	Mind: In Buddhism, usually the word “Mind” does not mean the brains, nor does the word “Heart” mean the physical organ. Both Mind and Heart, being the same character in Chinese, signify the spiritual entity of a living being, which is considered as the Primal Mover of everything, either within or without. Hence the Mind is not only the thinker, motivator, commander, and designer, but also the “feeler,” “recipient,” and the “ultimate enjoyer” of everything done or achieved, be it good or bad, sad or glad, thick or thin, life or death—the Mind would be the “Final Reaper.” 心 
11	Dharmas of Non-implementation: I.e., the Ultramundane Dharmas, or the Dharmas that can lead to Ultimate Liberation. “Implementation” means all kinds of illusory employments or undertakings of the worldly people. 無為法 
12	Kalpas: Sanskrit, aeons of ages. 劫、劫波 
13	Karma: Sanskrit; originally meaning “working,” “doing,” and “operation.” In one word, anything done, either visible or invisible, is considered as a Karma; for instance, the mental working is called “Mental Karma.” 業 
14	Multibeings: All living beings, either collectively or individually, are called “Multibeings” in that they are subjected to multiple Reincarnations until they realize Liberation of Nirvana or the Supreme Bodhi (Enlightenment). This term includes not just people (mankind), but also the Beings in five other Realms; viz., the Celestial, Asura, Starving Ghost, Purgatory and Animals. Together with Humanity, they are called the Six Realms which constitute the Realm of Transmigration or Samsara (Reincarnation). 眾生 
15	Five Precepts: the Precepts observed by a Buddhist lay practitioner. The lay Buddhist’s Five Precepts are: 1) No killing—including animals or insects; i.e., you shall not intentionally kill any Being that is endowed with life, without any exception, for (the development of) your Equal Mercy’s sake. 2) No stealing—you shall not steal anything belonged to and beloved by others, for compassion’s sake. 3) No inappropriate sex—You shall not compromise or vitiate the purity or chastity or fidelity of other people’s wife, mother, sister, or daughter, or husband, father, brother, or son, due to your practice on Buddha’s equal Compassion for all. 4) No lies—You shall not deceive others for your own profits or amusement, or trying to make a fool of others to entertain your conceitedness and false pride or vain superiority, due to your genuine practice on Buddha’s truthful wisdom, which would not come into existence with lies of any kind. 5) No intoxicants—For all intoxicants muddle up people’s thinking, weaken their will, perturb their mind, and incite their frail sentimentality, and so ultimately would hinder the practice of Buddha’s wisdom, you shall not use any intoxicant at all, not even one drop of it, due to your confirmed adherence to Buddha’s lucid, tranquil, self-controlled, uncontaminated Wisdom. 五戒 
16	Srota-apanna: Sanskrit, meaning “entering into Stream (of sainthood).” This is the first Fruition (or Consummation) of Hinayanaic Sainthood. The First Fruitioner can attain Arhathood and realize Nirvana after seven reincarnations (seven rebirths) in this world. 須陀洹 
17	Sakradagamin: the Second Consummation of Hinayanaic Sainthood. A Second Fruitioner will be able to attain Nirvana after one lifetime in the heaven and one rebirth (reincarnation) in this world. 斯陀含 
18	Anagamin: the Third Consummation of Hinayanaic Sainthood. The Third Fruitioner will no longer come back to this world to be reborn. Hence this will be his Final Lifetime in this world; and at the end of this life, he will be born in the Akanistha Heaven, the topmost heaven in the Matterful Domain, where he will realize Arhathood and attain Nirvana.阿那含 
19	Arhat: Arhathood is the fourth stage of Saintly Fruition in Hinayanaism, also the highest attestation, which enables an Arhat to attain Nirvana and be liberated from further Reincarnations. 羅漢、阿羅漢 
20	Pratyeka-buddha: Sansk., Causality-enlightenist, one who practices on the Tenet of Causality and thereby attains enlightenment, especially one who does so on ones own, or in an era when there is no Buddha or Buddha Dharma in the world; hence such a practitioner is also called a “Sole-enlightenist,” or “Lone-enlightenist.” 辟支佛、獨覺 
21	the Three Tempora: “Tempora,” pl. of Tempus. Tempus means time; hence, the Three Times, i.e., the past, the present and the future. 三世 
22	Good Guru: A good mentor endowed with sagacity, good virtue, and good method. 知識、善知識 
23	Expedite Means: I.e., expediencies, or conveniences; commonly translated as “Expediency,” which would easily incur misunderstanding of being unscrupulous. However, since the English word “expediency” carries a negative nuance or connotation of “the doing or consideration of what is of selfish use or advantage, rather than what is right or just” (as shown in the dictionaries), and so this term is, more often than not, misunderstood and misused and even abused by many readers of Sutras or even Buddhist practitioners; therefore, this translator has deliberately evaded using the easily misleading “Expediency,” by replacing it with “Expedite Means.” 方便 
24	Omniscient Wisdom: the supreme Wisdom (Noesis) acquired by Buddhas, which is all-inclusive and serve as the germinal source of all other wisdom. 一切智

29	Gatha: Sanskrit. A verse, usually composed of a quatrain (a four-line stanza), but it can be more than four lines. In Sanskrit, the Gatha used to be rhymed, but it is mostly unrhymed in the Chinese versions. 偈，偈陀， 伽陀，偈頌 
30	Vile Realms: I.e., the Three Vile Realms: Purgatory, Starving Ghost, and Animal, in which there are mostly Afflictions with scarce or no joy, and so the state of their existence is highly undesirable and detestable, hence they are called “vile.” 惡道 
31	Six Sensoria: I.e., the eye, ear, nose, tongue, physique (skin), and mind. One who is handicapped in any of the Six Sensors is termed as one with incomplete Sensors. 六根

36	Mundanity: I.e., worldliness, which is subject to Transiency. 世間、俗

Hence, altogether they are called the Three Thousand Mega-thousand Worlds, or just Mega-thousand Worlds. (“World,” meaning one solar system, not just the planet Earth.) 大千界，大千世界，三千大千世界
38	Haritaki fruit: Haritaki is a tree grown in southern China, Indo-china, and India. Its fruit, in the size of a date, sour and bitter in flavor, can be used as a medicine, good for excretion and urination. In Buddhist Scriptures, the Buddha frequently mentions it as a metaphor for something tiny but palpable to the eye when laid in the palm. 訶子，訶梨勒果
39	Anavatapta: Sanskrit, meaning the Temperately Cool Lake (清涼池), or the Lake of No Febrile Vexations (無熱惱池). Lying to the north of the Great Snow mountain, this lake is ascribed to be the source of the four great rivers in Jambudvipa. 阿耨池，阿耨達池
