The Sutra^f1 of Forty-two Chapters Divulged by the Buddha
Collaboratively translated from Sanskrit into Chinese by the Venerable Masters Kasyapa Matanga and Dharma-raksha in Eastern Han Dynasty (circa 67 AD)
Translated from Chinese into English by Venerable Cheng Kuan, 53rd-Generation Acharya of Shingon Sect,
 and 42nd Generation Lineage Patriarchate Successor of both Hua-Yen Sect and Sole-Cognizance Sect (1947-)
^n2 Namo Root Guru Shakyamuni Buddha.
(Recite three times,with your palms joined.)
The Sutra-opening Gatha
The supremely profound, wondrously sophisticated Dharma
Is hard to encounter in millions of Kalpas.
And now that I am able to hear, read, and uphold it,
I wish to comprehend the real import of the Thus-Adventist.
^n3 After the World-Venerated One^f2 had attained Enlightenment, He meditated thus:
 it is of supreme good to renounce Desires for Serenity, and to dwell in Grand Dhyanaic Stasis^f3 so as to subjugate the Mara’s^f4 Ways. 
Thereupon, He revolved the Dharmic Wheel of the Four Sacred Truths in Mrgadava to enlighten the five persons headed by Kaundinya and enabled them all to realize the Fructification of the Truthful-Way.^f5 
Apart from these, there were some other Bhiksus^f6 who expressed some doubts concerning the Sacred Dicta and implored the Buddha to remove those doubts for them. 
In the wake of the instructions and injunctions of the World-Venerated One, each and every one of them was enlightened. 
Hence all of them joined their palms, showing their compliance with the Sacred Edicts of the World-Venerated One deferentially.
^ck2【Body Text】^n1 Home-renunciation and Attestation of Fructification
The Buddha said, “A person entitled to the name of Sramana^f7 is one who has renounced the Worldly Home^f8 to join the Samgha^f9,  and is also able to take cognizance of the Mind^f10  to the point of reaching its Origin.
“Moreover, he also needs to comprehend the Dharmas of Non-implementation,^f11
 observe the two hundred and fifty Precepts of Bhiksuhood constantly. 
And when he is purified either in actions or in quietude, and has realized the Four Sacred Truths,
 he will be able to attain Arhathood. 
An Arhat is a Saint, who can fly and execute Transformations, and live to extensive Kalpas^f12 of time. 
And wherever he fares, he can move Heaven and Earth.
“The third stage of Sainthood is Anagamin.
 With respect to a Saint of Anagaminhood, at the end of his life here in this world, his spirit will ascend to the nineteenth level of Heaven (called the Arupa Heavens),
 wherein he will be realizing his Arhathood.
“The second stage of Sainthood is Sakradagamin. 
A Sakradagamin Saint is one who after one Rebirth in the heaven and one Rebirth in the world here, will be able to attain Arhathood.
“The initial stage of Sainthood is Srota-apanna. 
A Srota-apanna Saint is one who after seven Rebirths in this world will be able to realize Arhathood.
“A person who has renounced Love and Lusts can be compared to one whose limbs have been dissevered; 
once the limbs have been dissected, they would never come into use any more.”
^n2 Ch.2: Terminating Desires & Refraining from Seekings‧
The Buddha said, “What a Home-renouncing Sramana should be committed to do is to dissever all Lusts and discard all Loves,
 to take cognizance of his own Mental Origin and to comprehend the profound Buddhist Doctrines.
“He is to be enlightened in the Dharma of Non-implementation,
 so that he could realize that there is nothing to be obtained inwardly, and that he would quest for nothing outwardly, either.
“His mind would not be attached even to the Truthful Route, nor would he fabricate any more Karmas.^f13
“He would maintain in the Non-deliberation and Nonperformance, Non-cultivation and Non-attestation,
without appropriating the hierarchical stages of realizations, yet will he thus ascend the most prestigious status.
“And this is called the Buddhaic Way.”
^n3 Disseverance of Enamourment and Elimination of Avarice
The Buddha said, “A person who has shaved his hair and beards to become a Sramana,
 should espouse the Dharma of the Truthful-Way.
“He should abnegate all his worldly capitals and riches and live by begging for Alms. 
And in his Alms-begging he could receive only what is sufficient for one meal, take one meal in the noontime each day,
 and retire himself for the night under a tree. 
And he would do nothing more than this; 
for what could make a person ignorant and blindfolded is Love and Lust.”
^n4 Concurrent Definitions of Good and Evil
The Buddha said, “Multibeings^f14 could perform Virtues in ten ways, and so could they perpetrate Vices in ten ways. 
What are these Ten Vices? 
There are three in the Body, four in the Mouth, and three in the Mind.
“The three Physical Vices are Killing, Stealing and Copulation.
“The four Oral Vices are Alienating Speeches, Scurrilous Words, Untruthful Language, and Meaningless Chatters.
“The three Mental Vices are Jealousy, Resentment, and Ignorance.
“These Ten Vices are against the Sacred Way, and so they are also called the Ten Vile Deeds. 
If these Vices are terminated, that will result in the Ten Virtues.”
^n5 The Mitigation of Weighty Vices into Slight Ones
The Buddha said, “If a man has committed a number of faults,
 yet he never regrets anything about what he has done, and would not restrain his mind from wrong-doings right away; 
eventually the penalty of his sins will come to claim his body,
 just as all rivers flow into the sea, and thereby his sins will grow ever deeper and wider. 
“Whereas, when a man commits an error, he becomes aware of his own fault,
 and would try to correct the evil and to do good instead, then his sins will be mitigated and disappear. 
It is like a person who falls ill, but after he has perspired profusely, his illness will heal gradually.”
^n6 Forbear Vilities to Be Exempt from Resentment
The Buddha said, “When evil people hear about your good deeds, they might come to disturb and vex you on purpose. 
In this case, you should keep yourself restrained and tranquil, and do not get resentful and reprehend them. 
The evil deeds that they do would make none but the evildoers themselves evil.”
^n7 Malefactions Recoil to the Perpetrator
The Buddha said, “When someone heard that the Buddha observes the Truthful-Way and acts on Great Benevolence and Compassion, he should come to rebuke the Buddha. 
The Buddha simply kept reticent and would make no response to him; 
thereupon the revilement came to a halt.
“The Buddha then asked him, ‘If you bring a gift to someone, but he would not accept your gift, would the gift still belong to you?’ 
“The man replied, ‘Yes, it would.’
“The Buddha said, ‘Similarly, just now you rebuked me, and I did not accept any of the rebukes, 
hence you are to take all those rebukes back with their disastrous Retributions to yourself. 
This result is just like an echo reverberating to a sound, or like a shadow following close to the shape. 
There is no way to evade or avoid the consequences. 
Therefore, be careful not to commit any Wicked Deeds.’”
^n8 Dust-throwing and Spitting upward Befoul Oneself
The Buddha said, “When a vicious person attempts to do harms to virtuous people, it is just as he tries to spit upward at the heaven. 
Yet the spitting could not go so far as to reach the heaven, and in no time it would revert and fall upon the Spitter himself. 
“It can also be compared to someone who tries to throw some dusts to another person against the wind. 
Likewise, the dust would not go far enough to reach the person aimed at, but it would soon come back to smear the Thrower himself. 
“Therefore, do not try to malign virtuous people; 
the backfired disasters could destroy the Maligner himself.”
^n9 Returning to Origin to Convene with the Way
The Buddha said, “If a person loves the Truthful-Way and yet he tries to pursue it merely by extensive erudition,
 it would be hard for him to convene with the Truthful-Way. 
“If a man sustains his Mind and observes the Way, the Way shall grow immensely vast to him.”
^n10 Joyful Bestowals to Acquire Bliss
The Buddha said, “When you see someone practicing Donation,
 and though you merely assist him by encouraging and feeling joyful for him, the Merits you are to acquire would be quite a cornucopia.”
Then a monk asked, “Would the Merits of the Original Donor be diminished by sharing with others?”
The Buddha replied, “It is like the fire of a Torch: 
if hundreds or thousands of people would come each with a torch to ignite by that flame, each torch they have ignited from the original one could be used to cook meals and keep a dark house bright, 
and yet the Original Torch would stay as bright as it used to be. 
To share Merits with others is akin to that.”
^n11 The Escalating Blisses Acquired  from Various Recipients
The Buddha said, “You could offer food to a hundred vicious people, but it would be much better meritwise to make the offering to a virtuous man.
“You could offer food to one thousand virtuous people, but it would be much better meritwise to make the offering to one person who observes the Five Precepts^f15 decreed by the Buddha.
“You could offer food to ten thousand observers of Five Precepts, but it would be much better meritwise to make the offering to one Srota-apanna^f16 Saint.
“You could offer food to one million Srota-apanna Saints, but it would be much better merit-wise to make the offering to one Sakradagamin^f17 Saint.
“You could offer food to ten million Sakradagamin Saints, but it would be much better meritwise to make the offer to one Anagamin^f18 Saint.
“You could offer food to one hundred million Anagamin Saints, but it would be much better meritwise to make the offering to one Arhat.^f19
“You could offer food to one billion Arhats, but it would be much better meritwise to make the offering to one Pratyeka-buddha.^f20
“You could offer food to ten billion Pratyeka-buddhas, but it would be much better meritwise to make the offering to any one Buddha of the Three Tempora.^f21
“You could offer food to one hundred billion Buddhas of the Three Tempora,
 but it would be much better meritwise to make the offering to a practitioner in the state of Non-deliberation, Non-adherence, Non-cultivation and Non-attestation.”
^n12 To Exhort Practicing by Enunciating Difficulties
The Buddha said, “There are twenty Difficulties for ordinary people, namely:
“It is hard for them to make Donations when they are indigent.
“It is hard for them to learn the Truthful-Way when they are in nobility and in power.
“It is hard for people to disregard their lives and even to die for the sake of the Truthful-Way.
“It is hard for people to have the opportunity to read a Buddha’s Sutra.
“It is hard for people to be born at the same time with a Buddha.
“It is hard for people to withstand Coition and Desires.
“It is hard for people to have perceived something desirable and yet refrain themselves from the pursuit of it.
“It is hard for people to stay unangered when they are humiliated.
“It is hard for people not to become overbearing when they are in power.
“It is hard for people to maintain nonchalant when they have business at hand to cope with.
“It is hard for people to learn extensively and still be able to scrutinize catholically.
“It is hard for people to eliminate the Egoistic Arrogance.
“It is hard for people not to disparage the untutored.
“It is hard for people to be equitable in their Mental Activities.
“It is hard for people not to gossip about other people’s affairs.
“It is hard for people to encounter a genuine Good Guru.^f22
“It is hard for people to witness their own Original Nature in practicing the Truthful-Way.
“It is hard for people to deliver people pursuant to adventitious circumstances.
“It is hard for people to stay unmoved on perceiving a phenomenon.
“It is hard for people to comprehend the Expedite Means^f23 of Dharma and put them to use.”
^n13 Queries on Bodhi and Translifetime Wisdom
A certain Sramana asked the Buddha,
 “By what means can one attain the Supernal Translifetime Wisdom, as well as realize the Supreme Bodhi?”
The Buddha replied, “If one purifies one’s Mind and sustains one’s Aspiration, 
one will be able to attain the Supreme Bodhi. 
It is just like burnishing a brass Mirror. 
When the Tarnish has been removed, nothing will remain but the Brightness of the Mirror. 
“Therefore, if one extirpates one’s Desires and ceases all the Quests,
 one shall be able to attain the Supernal Translifetime Wisdom.”
^n14 Queries on Good and Greatness
A Sramana asked the Buddha, “What kind of people are good? 
What people are the greatest?”
The Buddha replied, “Those who practice the Truthful-Way and abide by the Truth are good.
“Those whose Minds are intermingled with the Truthful-Way are the greatest.”
^n15 Queries on Strength and Perspicacity
A Sramana asked the Buddha, “What people are mighty in strength? 
What people are most perspicacious in the mind?”
The Buddha answered, “Those who are forbearant are mighty in strength, for they would not bear grudges; 
what is more, for they are peaceful and strong, 
and without any embitterment; 
hence they will be the paragon among all.
“Those who have eliminated all their Mental Impurities, to the extent of being immaculate,
 can be said to be endowed with the most perspicacious minds,
 for there would be nothing that they could not see, nothing that they could not know, nothing that they could not hear, insomuch as to be all-inclusive up from the time when the Heaven and Earth were yet inexistent, down to this very day. 
Hence these people, who have acquired such Omniscient Wisdom,^f24 can be said to be endowed with the clearest minds.”
^n16 Forgoing Attachments to Attain Bodhi
The Buddha said, “if people cherish Love and Lusts, it is out of the question that they could Witness the Truthful-Way. 
“This can be compared to some clear water: if the water is perturbed by someone with his hands,
 people would not be able to view their own images in the water. 
“Therefore, if people perturb their own Mental Water with the transgressing Hands of Love and Lusts,
 Defilements will arise in the Mind to keep them from witnessing the Image of Truth. 
“In consequence, you people here as Sramanas, ought to discard Love and Lusts; 
and when the Defilements of Love and Lusts in your minds are completely extinguished,
 you shall be able to witness the Truth perspicuously.”
^n17 Light Comes to Supersede Darkness
The Buddha said, “The so-called Perceiving the Truthful-Way can be likened to someone holding a torch and entering into a pitch-dark room. 
As soon as he enters the room, the darkness therein will be eliminated with only the brightness remained. 
“Likewise, when a person has learned the Dharma to the extent of being able to perceive the Truthful-Way,
 the Darkness of Inanity within himself shall be eliminated, and the Internal Brightness shall be staying on ever after.”
^n18 Ideations et al Are Vacuous^f25 in Essence
The Buddha said, “My Dharma is to contemplate on the Ideation of Non-ideation, to execute the Action of Non-action,
 to divulge the Speech of Speechlessness, and to cultivate the Practice of Non-practice. 
“Those who could convene with this Dharma would be close to the Truthful-Way;
 whereas those who roam aberrantly would be lagging far away from it. 
“No sooner has one resorted to Words and Speeches for the Truthful-Way, 
than the Way is immediately blocked up; for the Truthful-Way cannot be captured by anything at all. 
Therefore, if a person misses it even as narrowly as by a hair’s breadth, he will still lose it within an instant.”
^n19 Contemplations on Both the Veracious^f26 and the Specious
The Buddha said, “Whenever you behold the Heaven and Earth, you should contemplate on the Impermanency of things. 
“Whenever you regard the World, you should contemplate on the Impermanency of things.
“Whenever you perceive the Wondrous Sensitivity of your own Mind, you should be aware that it is of the Bodhi. 
“If you can but cognize and realize it in this way, you shall be able to fulfill the Truthful-Way presently.”
^n20 Deducing Ego to Be Vacuous in Essence
The Buddha said, “You should contemplate on the fact that each of the Four Elements within your body is endowed with a name to itself; 
yet none of them is denominated as Me. 
Insomuch as the Me is entirely nonexistent in the Elements, that Me is only like an Illusion.”
^n21 Fame-seeking to Entail Loss of the Principal
The Buddha said, “Most people would follow their Sentiment and Desire to court for Fame; 
but most likely by the time their Fame has become conspicuous, their life has long been past as well.
“If a person lusts for perpetual fame without learning the Truthful-Way,
 he would be simply applying his exertions in vain and laboring his body in futility. 
“This can be compared to the burning of incense:
 the moment when you can smell the Aroma of the incense,
 the incense which has just produced the Aroma you are smelling right now has already been burned up and gone,
 and the only thing that is left behind at present would be merely the fire remained in the embers that has just consumed the body of the Incense.”
^n22 Wealth and Prurience Incur Afflictions
The Buddha said, “Riches and Sexuality are the two things hardest to renounce for common people. 
“This can be compared to the Blade of a knife spread with some honey. 
Even if the amount of the honey on the knife’s Blade would be too sparse for a meal; 
none the less, a child would still try to lap at the blade to ingest the honey thereon, with the jeopardy of cutting his own tongue.”
^n23 Spouse and Progeny Are More Binding Than Prisons
The Buddha said, “When a man is tethered to his spouse, progeny and homestead, it is much worse than his being incarcerated in a prison; 
for there is an end for the jail term, and in due time he will be released. 
However, a man generally would not occur to nurture the idea of leaving his wife. 
“When a man is moved and attached to Lust, he would not mind travelling far and wide just to get at it; 
even if there be the hazard of being devoured by a tiger on the way, he would still go for it full gladly and willingly. 
“This is the same as one who plunges himself into a quagmire, only to get himself drowned for nothing. 
Hence he is duly called a Common Plebeian.^f27 “
Anyone who is able to penetrate through this Threshold would make himself an Arhat, capable of disentangling himself from the Dusts.”
^n24 Carnal Lusts Impede Enlightenment
The Buddha said, “No Desire is more powerful than Carnal Lust. 
Sexuality as a Desire is so comprehensive that there is hardly anything beyond its bound. 
“Yet fortunately, among all Desires, this happens to be the only one that is so tremendously powerful; 
suppose there were another Desire equally powerful as Prurience, there would be no one in the whole wide world that could cultivate the Truthful-Way for Enlightenment.”
^n25 Lustful Fire Will Burn Oneself
The Buddha said, “A person who is indulged in Love and Lusts is likened to one who is faring against the wind while holding a torch in hand:
 beyond any doubt, this man is incurring the danger of burning his own hand.”
^n26 Celestial Mara to Distract Buddha
Once a Celestial Deity sent a comely maiden as a gift to the Buddha, with a view to destroying the mindfulness of the Buddha. 
Thence the Buddha said unto the maid, “Wrapped inside that physical Leather Bag of thine are nothing but all sorts of Foul Filth. 
What hast thou to do in coming hither? 
Be off now! I do not have any use of thee!” 
Henceforth the Deity nurtures much more veneration for the Buddha, and then he asked the Buddha respecting the import of the Truthful-Way. 
The Buddha then explained it to him; 
forthwith the Deity attained the Initial Fructification of Srota-apanna Sainthood.
^n27 Non-attachment to Attain Bodhi
The Buddha said, “The practice of the Truthful-Way can be compared to a piece of Log floating on the river. 
If this Log is drifting with the Current, without being caught at either side of the Shores, without being seized by Men, 
without being hindered by Spirits or Deities, without being arrested by Vortexes,
 and without getting rotten itself either, then would I vouch to say that this Log would definitely be able to get to the Sea. 
“In the like manner, if a Bodhi-learner is not confounded by Love and Lusts,
 nor is he detained by any Deviousness, and furthermore, he is able to practice assiduously on the Non-implementation,
 I would warrant that this person would definitely be able to realize the Truthful-Way.”
^n28 Release Not the Bridle for the Mental Steed
The Buddha said, “Take heed of this: not to trust your own Ideation, for your Ideations are untrustworthy. 
“Take heed also of this: not to get in contact with Sexuality, for any contact with Sexuality would incur disasters. 
“Only after you have attained Arhathood, could you place trust on your own Ideations.”
^n29 Right Contemplation to Withstand Pruriency
The Buddha said, “Mind you neither to lay eyes on females, nor to converse with them. 
If ever you should need to talk with them, at that very moment you should meditate with a right mind thus: 
“‘I am a member of Sramana; 
though being situated in this Defiled World, I should be like a Lotus^f28 Flower, without being smirched by the foul Dirt. 
“‘And the way in which I should take to look upon the female is that, if she be old, to look upon her as my own mother; 
if she be senior to me in age, as my elder sister; 
if she be junior to me, as my younger sister; 
if she be a minor, as my own child—
and to all of them, I should engender the Mind for their Deliverance and Liberation.’
“If you cultivate yourself in this way, all your vile thoughts will be extinguished.”
^n30 To Refrain from Lascivious Flames
The Buddha said, “One who practices the Truthful-Way is just like one who is attired in dry-straw garments. 
Such a person should by all necessity get away from any fire as far as possible. 
“By the same token, if a Truthful-Way Practitioner comes across any occasion of Lusts, he would be better off to stay away from it.”
^n31 Quieting the Mind to Eliminate Lechery
The Buddha said, “There was a man who suffered so much from incessant aphrodisia that he wished to cut off his own genitals. 
The Buddha told him: “Instead of cutting off the genitals, it would be much better to cut off the Mind. 
That Mind is compared to a Ringleader: when the Ringleader is apprehended, all his cohorts would disperse. 
Whereas, if the evil Mind is not brought under subjugation, what would it avail to cut off the genitals?”
Thereupon the Buddha recited a Gatha^f29 for him:
The lascivious desires emerge from your Mind,
And the Mind is generated by your Thinking;
If both the Mind and Thinking stay calm and quiet,
They reveal themselves to be neither of Corporality nor of Impulsion.
The Buddha then remarked, “This Gatha was originally divulged by Kasyapa Buddha in the past.”
^n32 Vacuity of Ego to Terminate Fear
The Buddha said, “People derive their Worries from their own Love and Lusts; 
and from Worries in turn they derive their Fears. 
“If they could but stay away from Love and Lusts, what is there to be worried about and feared for?”
^n33 Noetic Perspicacity to Destroy Mara
The Buddha said, “A person devoted to practicing the True Way is like a man who is going to wedge war on ten thousand opponents. 
“Therefore, when he puts on his armors and gets ready to march out, at that instant he might become timid and frail,
 or he might retreat halfway, or he might fight to death, or he might return victorious. 
“By the same token, a Sramana trying to practice the Truthful-Way should fortify his Mind unrelentingly. 
Besides, he should be assiduous, brave and keen, and should confront the circumstances in front of him undauntedly. 
And he also needs to vanquish and annihilate all the Maras, so as to attain the Fructifications of the Truthful-Way.”
^n34 The Golden Mean to Attain Bodhi
A monk was chanting The Sutra Bequeathed by Kasyapa Buddha. 
His voice was distressing and tense, and he became remorseful and was considering about retreating from the Truthful-Way.
The Buddha asked him, “What did you do when you were a layman at home?” 
He replied to the Buddha, “I was fond of playing on the harp.”
The Buddha said, “What would happen when the strings became lax?”
He said, “It would be unable to produce a sound.”
The Buddha then inquired, “What if the strings were tense?”
He responded, “The sound would become strident.”
The Buddha asked, “If the strings were maintained betwixt laxity and tenseness, what would happen then?”
He replied, “All the sounds brought about would be even and smooth.”
The Buddha then said, “It would be just the same with a Sramana practicing on the Truthful-Way. 
If the Mind is adjusted properly, the Truthful-Way could be realized. 
In the course of Practice, if the Mind should become rash, it would bring forth fatigue in the body; 
when the body becomes fatigued, the Mind in turn will be irritated. 
If the Mind is irritated, the Practice will be retrograding. 
If the practice is retrograded, faults and sins will befall you. 
“You need but stay purified, peaceful and joyful, and the Truthful-Way shall not be lost to your sight.”
^n35 Purification of Tarnish Restores the Luster
The Buddha said, “As a person forges iron to get rid of the dregs in the iron, he would be able to make an article out of it. 
The article thus made will be good and refined; 
so does a practitioner of the Truthful-Way: 
if he could get rid of his Mental Defilements at the outset,
^n36 Supremacy Gained by Alternation
The Buddha said, “It is hard for one to evade the Reincarnation in the Vile Realms,^f30 so as to be born in the humanity. 
“When one is born as human, still it is hard for one to be born a male person, instead of a female.
“When born as a man, it is still harder for one to be born totally sound and whole in the Six Sensoria.^f31
“Being sound and whole in the Six Sensoria, it is even harder for one to be born in a country of Buddhism.
“When one is born in a country of Buddhism, it is much harder for one to be born right at the time while a Buddha is preaching in the world.
“When one is born at the same time with a Buddha, it would be all the harder to convene with the Truthful-Way.
“After convening with the Truthful-Way, it is harder for one to generate Faith.
“When one has generated Faith, it is even harder for one to generate Bodhi Heart.^f32
“After the generation of the Bodhi Heart, it is hard for one to be enlightened on the Non-practice and Non-attestation.”
^n37 Cogitating Precepts to Approach Bodhi
The Buddha said, “If a person, as a Buddha’s disciple, always bears in mind the Precepts that I have taught and keeps contemplating on them, even if he is as far as several thousand miles away from me, 
he would assuredly attain the Fructification of Bodhi.^f33
“On the contrary, if a disciple always stays at my elbows and is able to behold me from day to day, 
but he would not observe my Precepts, such a disciple would never be able to fulfill Bodhi.”
^n38 Where There Is Generation There Is Expiration
The Buddha asked a Sramana, “How long is the dura-tion of Life?”
The monk replied, “Only for a few days.”
The Buddha remarked, “You have not perceived the Truthful-Way yet.”
The Buddha then asked another monk, “What is the duration of Life?”
This monk replied, “Only between one meal and another.”
The Buddha remarked, “You have not comprehended the Truthful-Way, either.”
The Buddha asked yet another monk, “What is the duration of Life?”
He replied, “Between the Inhalation and the Exhalation of a breath.”
The Buddha remarked, “Very good, indeed. You have already comprehended the Truthful-Way.”
^n39 No Disparities in Buddha’s Holy Teachings
The Buddha said, “One who learns the Buddhaic Way should believe and comply with all that the Buddha has taught. 
It could be likened to someone ingesting honey or a honey cake: 
in doing that, generally he would feel the sides of the cake as sweet as that in the middle of it. 
Thus the Sutras that I have divulged unto you are just the same as that.”
^n40 The Prosecution of the Modus Lies in the Mind
The Buddha said, “when a Sramana is practicing Perambulating Meditation,^f34 he should not do it in the fashion of an ox rotating around a grain mill; 
for in that way albeit his body appears to ambulate in meditation, his mind is not meditating at all.
“Ultimately speaking, if a person actually ambulates on the Mental Way, why would he need the pedestrian ambulation after all?”
^n41 Straightforward Mindfulness to Extricate from Desires
The Buddha said, “One who practices the Truthful-Way is just like a cow laden with a heavy load on its back and trudging along in a deep marsh. 
Now the cow is extremely exhausted, yet it is so concentrated on the footsteps that it would not dare to glance sideways; 
for it could not afford to relax itself until it gets out of the bog. 
“A Sramana ought to look upon Sentiments and Desires as far more entrapping than Marshes. 
If he is concentrated on the contemplation of the Truthful-Way with a straightforward mind, ^f35 he shall be released from all Afflictions.”
^n42 Apprehending Mundanity^f36 to be Like Phantasmata
The Buddha said, “I look upon the distinctive positions of kings and dukes as the Gossamers reflected in the sunlight passing through the crevice of a door. 
“I regard the treasure of gold and jade as broken tiles and rubbles. 
“I view silky attire as worn-out cotton garb.
“I contemplate the Mega-thousand Worlds^f37 as a Haritaki fruit.^f38
“I view the water in Lake Anavatapta^f39 as foot-embalming oil. 
“I view the Expedite Means for the Dharma like a hoard of Metamorphosed Treasure. 
“I contemplate the Supreme Yana as gold and silver appropriated in a Dream. 
“I envisage the Buddhaic Way as a flower efflorescing contingently in front of me. 
“I visualize Dhyanaic Stasis as the Pillars of Mount Sumeru.^f40
 “I contemplate Nirvana^f41 as the Awakening after a night and day’s Sleep.
“I view Perversions and Proprieties as Six Dragons involved and entangled in a Dance. 
“I view Equality as the Terra^f42 of One-Veracity.^f43 
“I contemplate the Advents and Inculcations of the Buddhas as divers plants burgeoning pursuant to their own Seasons.”
After hearing what the Buddha had divulged, all the Grand Bhiksus^f44 were jubilant and would practice accordingly.
End of The Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters Divulged by the Buddha.
^n43 The Dedicatory Gatha
I wish to abolish the Three Impediments,
And to obtain Wisdom, thereby to achieve mental perspicuity.
I also wish people universally to diminish and exterminate all their Sinful Impediments,
And all of us to practice the Pusa’s Way in all our future Lives to come.
